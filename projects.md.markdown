## Project 1

### How does hardware work?

In this project, our team constructed basic logic gates using transistors and other electronic components. Over the three lab visits, we successfully built NOT, AND, OR, XOR, and NAND gates. Each team member contributed effectively and played an important role throughout the process. By collaborating and working hands-on with the circuits, we gained a deeper understanding of how fundamental logic gates function at the component level.
