## Project 1

### How does hardware work?

In this project, our team constructed basic logic gates using transistors and other electronic components. Over the three lab visits, we successfully built NOT, AND, OR, XOR, and NAND gates. Each team member contributed effectively and played an important role throughout the process. By collaborating and working hands-on with the circuits, we gained a deeper understanding of how fundamental logic gates function at the component level.

## Project 2

### Hour of Code

In this project, we visited a school to tell the students about ADA University and about our school. We gave them information and answered their questions. After that, we showed them how to use a platform called Bug Arena, which is part of Microsoft. The students worked on the platform and finished their tasks successfully.
We also planned a group activity that let them work together. They really enjoyed this part and had fun as a team.
At the end of the day, we gave each student a certificate with their name on it. They were really happy and excited to receive their certificates. It was a great experience for everyone involved.
